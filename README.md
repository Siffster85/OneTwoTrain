# One Two Train

## What is OneTwoTrain?

OneTwoTrain is an application we developed to improve people's experiences with a fitness-centric lifestyle. The app is primarily designed for people who attend a gym and want to keep track of their performance to make better improvements. OneTwoTrain allows the user to create their own custom exercises, specifying how many sets to complete within the exercise as well as the ability to tailor the metric input. For example, set the amount of weight to lift and how many reps, or select the distance and time for cardio-related exercises.

When creating an account on OneTwoTrain, the user will be asked a series of questions to help the app decide what the user's recommended daily calorie intake should be to reach maximum performance. In the app itself, this data can be updated whenever the user wishes to keep the recommended information accurate and up to date. Another useful and essential feature OneTwoTrain has is its water tracker. This feature allows the user to track how much water they have drank within the day, ensuring the user is well hydrated, especially when working out.
